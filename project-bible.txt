CYDENTI — PROJECT BIBLE (MASTER DOCUMENT)
A foundational guide for AI systems, teams, and future content generation
1. INTRODUCTION

Cydenti is a modern Identity Security platform built for SaaS- and cloud-driven enterprises.
It focuses exclusively on identity blind spots, not IAM workflows or governance tasks.

The platform unifies and analyzes:

Human identities

Machine identities

Service accounts

Cloud roles

OAuth apps / 3rd-party integrations

AI agents

LLM-driven workflows

SaaS configurations

Cloud IAM policies

Behavioral signals

Cydenti exists to give organizations clear visibility, intelligent risk prioritization, and automated identity posture management across the entire SaaS & cloud ecosystem.

It is not an IAM tool. Not an SSO tool. Not a compliance platform.
It is an Identity Security platform — a new category emerging globally.

2. WHAT PROBLEM CYDENTI SOLVES

Modern enterprises have an identity problem:

2.1 Identity is the main attack surface

Users, machines, and now AI agents act across many systems.
Attackers target identities > 70% of breaches (industry-wide trend).

2.2 SaaS environments are misconfigured

Most enterprises cannot see:

who has access

how much access they have

what SaaS apps are doing

how third-party integrations behave

where settings drift

where data exposure occurs

2.3 AI agents are entering enterprise systems

AI systems can:

read data

write configurations

trigger workflows

access files

connect to APIs

This creates new identity paths and high-risk automations that are invisible today.

2.4 Cloud IAM is extremely complex

Cloud permissions are granular, evolving, and hard to evaluate manually.

2.5 Compliance requires continuous evidence

Frameworks like:

GDPR

ISO

SOC 2

NIS2

DORA

…require proof of identity and configuration controls.

Teams do not have the time or visibility to maintain compliance manually.

3. CYDENTI — CORE VALUE PROPOSITION
“The Sovereign Intelligence Layer for SaaS, Cloud & Identity Blind Spots.”

Cydenti delivers:

Complete identity visibility (human, machine, AI)

Misconfiguration & exposure detection

Risk prioritization powered by AI/LLMs

SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)

Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR)

Cloud identity exposure monitoring

Third-party/OAuth oversight

Automated compliance evidence

It serves as the intelligence layer that sits on top of SaaS + cloud environments, connecting identity signals to risk.

4. HOW CYDENTI WORKS (HIGH LEVEL)
4.1 Agentless, API-based integrations

No agents, no deploy friction.

Integrates with:

Microsoft 365

Google Workspace

Salesforce

AWS IAM

Azure AD

GCP IAM

GitHub

Slack

ServiceNow

And more…

4.2 Cydenti’s Detection Engine

Combines:

configuration scanning

permission analysis

behavioral anomaly detection

identity drift detection

cloud IAM exposure mapping

AI agent behavior tracking

SaaS posture evaluation

4.3 In-house LLMs

Cydenti uses in-house, privacy-focused LLMs for:

reasoning over identity graphs

summarizing security issues

suggesting remediations

correlating risk between SaaS → cloud → identity → agents

pattern detection in human + machine + AI activity

contextual prioritization

4.4 AI Agent Monitoring

Cydenti uniquely monitors:

agent-initiated actions

unintended automations

over-scoped permissions

cross-app workflows triggered by AI

agent impersonation or credential abuse

4.5 Unified Identity Graph

All identities, permissions, behaviors, roles, policies, apps, and configurations are mapped in one model.

5. PRODUCT PILLARS

Cydenti is built on three pillars:

Pillar 1 — Identity Threat Detection (ITDR)

Detect high-risk identity activity across SaaS and cloud:

suspicious privilege changes

abnormal login behavior

token misuse

impersonation attempts

agent-driven anomalies

privilege escalation paths

Goal: Stop identity threats before they become incidents.

Pillar 2 — SaaS & Cloud Posture Management (SSPM)

Continuously detect:

misconfigurations

risky permissions

shadow SaaS

misaligned roles

agent-induced drift

exposure pathways

Goal: Minimize SaaS and cloud identity attack surface.

Pillar 3 — Identity Exposure Intelligence

Score risks and offer contextual remediation:

unified risk score

blast-radius evaluation

identity-level exposure mapping

role trust analysis

“fix-first” prioritization powered by LLM reasoning

Goal: Give teams clarity and confidence in every security decision.

6. SOLUTIONS WE OFFER
• Identity Threat Detection (ITDR)
• SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)
• Cloud IAM Exposure Analysis
• Shadow AI & AI Agent Monitoring
• OAuth & Third-Party Integration Oversight
• Identity Risk Scoring & Prioritization
• Compliance Evidence Automation
7. WHY CYDENTI IS DIFFERENT
Sovereign AI & Data Privacy

All AI models run in-house, not on shared third-party LLM infrastructure.
No customer identity data leaves the platform boundary.

Identity-First Approach

Not IAM.
Not SIEM.
Not a CSPM.
Not just SaaS.
Identity-first security, unified.

Understands AI Agents

Most tools are blind to automated workflows and agent-driven activity.
Cydenti is designed to detect and secure them.

Unifies SaaS + Cloud + Identity into one view

Competitors cover pieces.
Cydenti covers the whole.

Deploys in minutes

Agentless.
API-first.

8. TARGET CUSTOMERS

Mid-sized to large enterprises

Cloud-first or SaaS-heavy organizations

Security-led teams

Identity & Access teams

Cloud security teams

Regulated industries

AI-adopting organizations

9. TONE OF VOICE & MESSAGING STYLE

All messaging for Cydenti must be:

✔ Clear, direct, and outcome-driven
✔ Not salesy
✔ No buzzwords unless meaningful
✔ Modern, enterprise, trustworthy
✔ Slightly technical but approachable
✔ Confident, not exaggerated
✔ Identity-first, not IAM-first
✔ SaaS + cloud + AI agent aware
✔ Privacy & sovereignty forward

Avoid writing:

× Jargon-heavy sentences
× Overly long paragraphs
× IAM/GRC-focused messaging
× Over-claiming “magic AI”

Tone should feel similar to:

Wiz

CrowdStrike

Exabeam (modern version)

Veza (identity clarity)

AppOmni (SaaS posture)

10. KEY TERMINOLOGY (for AI consistency)
Identity Security

Protection focused on identities and permissions, not authentication or provisioning.

Non-human identities (NHI)

Machine identities, service accounts, cloud roles, scripts.

AI Agents

Autonomous systems capable of performing actions across SaaS / cloud environments.

Shadow AI

AI workflows or agents introduced without security oversight.

Permission Drift

Accumulation of excessive privileges over time.

SaaS Misconfiguration

Any setting or permission in SaaS apps that creates exposure.

Unified Identity Graph

Cydenti’s complete model of all identities, roles, behaviors, connections, and configurations.

11. STRATEGIC NARRATIVE

Cydenti is building the intelligence layer that enterprises will rely on as SaaS, cloud, and AI agents reshape the attack surface.

Identity is no longer limited to a username and password.
Today, identity is:

a human

a machine

a cloud role

an automation

an OAuth link

an API key

a workflow

a LLM-powered agent

Security teams must protect all of it — not just the user account.

Cydenti is the sovereign, AI-powered platform built to secure this era of identity complexity.

12. VISION

To become the world's most trusted identity security intelligence layer, delivering:

complete visibility

faster detection

smarter prioritization

automated security outcomes

…across human, machine, and AI-driven environments.

13. HOW AI SHOULD USE THIS BIBLE

website copy

product descriptions

UI wording

pitch content

messaging

marketing materials

documentation

persona-based messaging

…must align with:

✔ The identity-first framing
✔ AI & agent awareness
✔ Sovereign / privacy-focused positioning
